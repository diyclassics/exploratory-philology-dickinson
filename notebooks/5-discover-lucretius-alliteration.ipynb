    "Let's turn now to another kind of literary formalism, namely alliteration. As we did in the previous notebook, the key is to identify the specific letters of interest in the specific words of interest in the specific works of interest. And for that reason our work is already pretty far along for this experiment. Like with the clearchics, we are interested in the first letter of each word, not only at the beginning of lines but sequential through out our texts. Take this line from Lucretius:\n",

We are not as good at collecting, counting, arranging, and presenting this information, at least not without some increased level of deliberate effort. Computers can help us bridge the gap between \"there are a lot of *v* consonants\" and \"there are five—and exactly five—*v* consonsants\" in a given sentence. Our Python code can be seen then as an extension of our existing reading practice and with that extended reading practice at hand we are in an excellent position to not only **Discover** more features latent in the texts, but then to use them as the basis for arguments about the texts themselves and in comparison with other texts. It is still up to us as philologists to analyze and interpret what we find, but can do so now from a faster, more systematic, and more comprehensive position."
